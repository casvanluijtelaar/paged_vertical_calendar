## :hammer: How it works 
`paged_vertical_calendar` is a very minimalistic framework that automatically loads months based on scoll behavior. It provides many useful callbacks to implement your own calendar interactions and builders to customize the calendar as much as you want. Check the example for several implementations like date range selection and paginated data visualisation.

`PagedVerticalCalendar` has no required parameters and can be dropped in anywhere providing it has a fixed height.

```dart
Scaffold(
  body: PagedVerticalCalendar(),
);
```
## :loudspeaker: functionality

Several callback are provided to facilitate easy implementation of any calendar interactions

```dart
PagedVerticalCalendar(
  minDate: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days 365)),
  maxDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days 365)),
  initialDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days 3)),
  invisibleMonthsThreshold: 1,
  startWeekWithSunday: true,
  onMonthLoaded: (year, month) {
    // on month widget load 
  },
  onDayPressed: (value) {
    // on day widget pressed   
  },
  onPaginationCompleted: (direction) {
    // on pagination completion
  },
);
```
* `onMonthLoaded` is a callback that fires for every month added to the list. When this function fires can be altered by setting the `invisibleMonthsThreshold` pararamter. 

* `invisibleMonthsThreshold` decides how many months outside of the widgets view should be loaded. In other words, how many months should be preloaded before the user reaches that scroll position. It defaults to `1`.

* `onDayPressed` Is a simple `onPressed` callback but also provides the `DateTime` of the day that has been pressed.

* If your app is localized for countries where the week starts on  Sunday, you can flip `startWeekWithSunday`to `true`.

* If a `minDate` is provided the calendar will stop scrolling up at that date. make sure `minDate` < `maxDate`. 

* If a `maxDate` is provided the calendar will stop scrolling down at that date. make sure `maxDate` > `minDate`. 

* If an `initialDate` is provided the calendar start by displaying this date (otherwise `DateTime.now()`). make sure `minDate` < `initialData` < `maxDate`. 

* Finally when a `minDate` or `maxDate` is provided to the `PagedVerticalCalendar`, the `onPaginationCompleted` callback can be used. it will return a `PaginationDirection` to indicate what side of the calendar has been reached.




## :art: Customization

 `PagedVerticalCalendar` provides default calendar styling, but these can be fully customized. To do so, several builders are provided:

```dart
PagedVerticalCalendar(
  monthBuilder: (context, month, year) {
    // provide a month header widget
  },
  dayBuilder: (context, date) {
    // provide a day widget
  },
  listPadding: // provide EdgeInset value
);
```

* `monthBuilder` provides the year and month as `integers`. this builder has to return a widget that will form the header of ever month. the [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package works well here for date formatting.

* `dayBuilder` provides the day as a `DateTime`. this builder wil be called for every day. You usually want to provide at least a text widget with the current day number.

* `listPadding` can be provided in case you need the list to have padding.
